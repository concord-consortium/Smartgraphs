/** @class
  
  State representing that the currently open ActivityStep has been submitted.
  
  In this state, the user's response is processed and evaluated, and the system may branch to a new step. (Transitions
  between steps are not allowed in other states.) 
  
  A step's 'afterSubmissionCommands' are executed upon entry to this state, and then the activityStepController
  examines the user's response and issues a gotoStep command appropriately.
  
  If no step is branched to while the activityStepController processes the user's response, the 'isFinalStep' property
  is examined to determine if the current step is intended to be a terminal step. If this step is a terminal step in
  the page, the system transitions to the ACTIVITY_PAGE_DONE state. If this step is not intended to be a terminal 
  step and no step has been branched to, it is considered an error.
