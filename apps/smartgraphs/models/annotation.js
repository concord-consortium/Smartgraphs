/** @class

  This is the abstract superclass of all Annotation types. The various subclasses of Annotation have a corresponding
  'viewClass' property which identifies the SC.View class which is instantiated by the GraphView in order to view
  an instance of that annotation on a graph.
  
  Within an activity document, annotations are referenced by name. (In order to create a new annotation within the
  user's session, the document must also specify the annotation type to be created.) This allows the serialized form
  of an activity to reference specific annotation objects using any human readable name the author chooses.
  
  Annotations names are unique within an activity; it is a runtime error to create two annotations with the same name
  during a single user session. The authoring tool will enforce this restriction before allowing an activity to be
  published, so that such runtime errors should not be encountered in practice.
  
  Annotations can also be associated with sessions so that it is possible to save a user's session, and to analyze
  which annotations were created within a particular session.
