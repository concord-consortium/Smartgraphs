/** @class

  A ActivityStep represents a single step in a given activity page. Each Activity Page represents a recognizable 'chunk' of 
  work to be done, or one general question a user is being asked. Actually doing the work, or answering the question, 
  may take or may not take several steps.
  
  The point of breaking ActivityPages down into ActivitySteps is to allow ActivitySteps to provide progressively more hints to 
  a learner, if they are needed, or to activity a user (author or learner) through several steps in a chunk of work, one
  at a time.
  
  (This hierarchical structure -- one Activity contains many Activity Pages, each of which contains several Activity Steps -- 
  seems to be generally useful.)
  
  I called these DialogTurns in an earlier version of Smartgraphs, but did not find that nomenclature congenial.
