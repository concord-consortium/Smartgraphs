/** @class

  A GuidePage is one 'page' in a learner Guide (which steps learners through a complicated learning activity, and 
  helps them generate various artifacts during that acitivity, such as a lab book or slide show presentation) 
  
  *OR*

  It can be one page in an Author Guide (which steps an author through the process of generating a Learner Guide).
