  GraphController for the 'first' graph being displayed. If a split pane is being displayed, and the top pane is
  showing a graph, then this controller represents this graph. (If that pane is not showing a graph, this 
  controller should not have an open graph.) If a single pane is being displayed and is showing a graph, this
  controller represents that graph.
