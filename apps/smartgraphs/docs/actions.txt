These actions are explicitly used by the application (not counting 'startCommands' in activities, nor sendAction() calls in tests):

as Smartgraphs.statechart.sendAction():

errorSavingActivity
submitStep
waitForResponse
setPaneConfig
hidePane
showGraph
showTable
showImage
startInteractiveSelection
enableSubmission
disableSubmission
gotoStep
freehandSketchCompleted
sensorHasLoaded
waitForSensorToLoad
stopSensor
openActivity
gotoNextPage
dataPointSelected


as 'action' property of a control:

startControlWasClicked
stopControlWasClicked
clearControlWasClicked
openAuthorView
runActivity
saveActivity
gotoPreviousPage
gotoNextPage

======

Of the above, these don't make sense as actions:

setPaneConfig
hidePane
showGraph
showTable
showImage
waitForResponse


Of the above, these use "pseudostates" maintained by flags as a legacy of responder-chain limitations:

enableSubmission
disableSubmission
