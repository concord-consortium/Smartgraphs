Let’s look more closely at the velocities of the two balls from the time they were released until the time they reached the ground.

First, you will mark the portion of the graph that <i>best represents</i> the period when the ball was falling.

  * Select a point at which the ball is falling. (Try to pick the beginning of the region that <i>best represents</i> when the ball was falling.)
  
    * Incorrect. The ball was not yet falling at this point.
    
    * Incorrect. When the velocity is 0 (or nearly 0), the ball is not falling.
    
    * Incorrect. The velocity was nonzero in the highlighted region of the graph. This is when the ball was falling. Choose a point in this region.
    
    * Incorrect. The point you selected was not in the highlighted region in which the ball was falling. Try again.
    
  * Now select a second point at which the ball was falling. (Try to pick the end of the region that <i>best represents</i> when the ball was falling.)
  
    * Incorrect. The ball was not yet falling at this point.
  
    * Incorrect. When the velocity is 0 (or nearly 0), the ball is not falling.
  
    * Incorrect. The velocity was nonzero in the highlighted region of the graph. This is when the ball was falling. Choose a point (different than the first) in this region.
    
    * Incorrect. The point you selected was not in the highlighted region in which the ball was falling. Try again.
    
  * Incorrect. The point you selected is the same as the first point you selected. You cannot calculate the slope with this selection.
    

The slope of a velocity-time graph tells us how the velocity of an object changed over time. 

A line connecting the points you selected is shown to the right.

The slope of this line is a good approximation of the slope of the velocity-time graph during the time when the ball fell.

  * What is the slope of the line between the points you selected, in m/s<sup>2</sup>?
  
  * Incorrect. What is the slope of the line between the points you selected, in m/s<sup>2</sup>?
  
    Hint: Recall that the slope is the change in the velocity at the two points, divided by the change in the time.
    
    * Incorrect. What was the change in the velocity of the ball, in m/s?
  
      Hint: look at the graph.
    
    * Incorrect. What was the change in the velocity of the ball, in m/s?
  
      Hint: look at the table and the graph.
    
    * Incorrect. The change in the velocity of the ball was %@ m/s - %@ m/s, or %@ m/s
    
    * What is the change in time between the points you selected, in seconds?
  
      Hint: look at the graph.
      
    * Correct! What is the change in time between the points you selected, in seconds?

      Hint: look at the graph.
      
    * Incorrect. What is the change in time between the points you selected, in seconds?

      Hint: look at the table and the graph.
      
    * Incorrect. The change in time between the points is %@ s - %@ s, or %@ s.
    
    * If the change in velocity is %@ m/s during a change in time of %@ s, then what is the slope of the velocity-time graph, in m/s<sup>2</sup>?
    
    * Correct! If the change in velocity is %@ m/s during a change in time of %@ s, then what is the slope of the velocity-time graph, in m/s<sup>2</sup>?
  
    * Incorrect. If the change in velocity is %@ m/s during a change in time of %@ s, then what is the slope of the velocity-time graph, in m/s<sup>2</sup>?
    
      Hint: Recall that the slope between two points on a velocity-time graph will be the change in velocity between the two points divided by the change in time between the two points.
      
    * Incorrect. If the change in velocity is %@ m/s during a change in time of %@ s, then the slope is %@ m/s<sup>2</sup>
  
    * Correct! The slope of the velocity-time graph between the points you selected is %@ m/s<sup>2</sup>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
    <p>In the 1600s, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) hypothesized that objects of different masses would fall at the same
    rate when they were dropped from the same height and allowed to fall freely. According to legend, Galileo dropped
    an iron cannon ball and a wooden ball from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to test his hypothesis.</p>

    <h1>Predict the Graphs (Light Ball)</h1>
    
    <p>To test Galileo’s hypothesis, you are going to drop same-sized balls of different masses from a fixed
    height.</p>
    
    <p>Decide what you will use for the light and heavy balls. (The heavy ball should be at least five times heavier
    than the light ball.) Then try dropping each ball from a height of at least 2.5 meters.</p>

  Step 1.
 
    <p>To the right, predict what you think the position-time graph and velocity-time graph for the light ball will
    look like.</p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    
    <p>Do heavier objects fall faster?</p>
    
    <p>In this activity, you predicted and tested whether a light ball would fall faster than a heavier ball, just as
    Galileo likely did.</p>
    
    <p>According to legend, Galileo observed that the two balls fell at the same rate. He explained that this
    phenomenon was due to the effects of gravity acting on the two balls in a similar way.</p>
