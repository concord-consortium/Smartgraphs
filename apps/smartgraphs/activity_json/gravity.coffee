        <h1>Introduction</h1>
      
        <p>In the 1600s, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) hypothesized that objects of different masses would fall at the
        same rate when they were dropped from the same height and allowed to fall freely. According to legend, Galileo
        dropped an iron cannon ball and a wooden ball from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to test his hypothesis.</p>

        heavier than the light ball.) Then try dropping each ball from a height of at least 2.5 meters.</p>
