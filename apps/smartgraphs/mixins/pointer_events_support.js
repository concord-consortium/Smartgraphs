/** @class

  Mix this into a view to bind the layer's 'pointer-events' style property to the 'pointerEvents'
  property of the view. This can be used to make a view transparent to mouse and touch events by
  setting the view's 'pointerEvents' property to the value 'none'.

  For browsers that do not implement pointer-events (essentially, just IE), we also capture mouse
  events on the view's layer and re-fire them on the element beneath the view. Note this fallback
  mechanism is not used for touch events, because essentially all touch-enabled browsers we care
  about support the 'pointer-events' property.
