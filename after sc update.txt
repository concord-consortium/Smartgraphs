Can't see what you're typing when typing in label

all pages
pink line under button


on android:

text field behavior is much better:

 * now the onscreen keyboard only comes up when you tap on the textarea
 * "next" button is visible/tappable when keyboard is visible
 * next button correctly enables as soon as you type

can't drag label bodies (at least not very well; labels highlight blue and move to foreground when tapped)

* bottom bar still pushes up too far when keyboard appears


on ipad:

text field behavior is better:
  * next button becomes enabled as soon as you begin typing
  * however, to *see* the next button requires splitting the keyboard

labels work reasonably well

just as in desktop, can't see label text when entering

prediction graph works okay
